      <div class="deal-body">Brennan Investment Group completed the acquisition of an ±80,000 square foot building in Woodridge, Illinois, as part of its strategy to capitalize on the region&#x27;s shortage of functional small bay industrial product. The property&#x27;s precast construction and low building-to-land coverage make it ideal for conversion into a small bay industrial facility, with Brennan planning to demise the building into four 20,000-square-foot suites. This latest acquisition is consistent with the firm&#x27;s emphasis on acquiring industrial assets in submarkets with strong fundamentals, expanding its portfolio to 30 million square feet in the greater Midwest.</div>
