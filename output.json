TOKYO , Oct. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- ASUENE Inc. today announced that its U.S. subsidiary, ASUENE USA , has completed the full acquisition and integration of Iconic Air, Inc. , a leading U.S.-based SaaS provider specializing in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions monitoring and methane-leak detection. Iconic Air has officially joined the ASUENE Group, further accelerating its North American growth and strengthening its technology foundation for data-driven decarbonization. \"This acquisition marks a pivotal step in advancing our U.S. presence,\" said Kohei Nishiwada , Founder & CEO of ASUENE Inc. \"With Iconic Air's proven technology and strong customer base, we can now deliver integrated solutions addressing both CO\u2082 and methane emissions\u2014empowering companies across sectors to accelerate their green transformation.\" Strategic Synergies By combining ASUENE's global carbon accounting and supply chain management platform with Iconic Air's advanced GHG monitoring, methane-leak management, and asset-tracking tools, the Group will provide a unified system for operational and environmental data management. The integrated platform enables energy-sector operators to measure, visualize, and manage emissions with greater precision\u2014supporting compliance, reporting, and real-time performance optimization. Drawing on Iconic Air's Emissions Intelligence\u2122 capabilities, the collaboration expands ASUENE's reach into high-emissions industries such as oil and gas, where data accuracy and speed are crucial under evolving U.S. EPA regulations, the Inflation Reduction Act and market pressures from investors. The synergy brings together ASUENE's expertise in supply-chain carbon transparency with Iconic Air's real-time emissions analytics\u2014advancing digital sustainability across North America. \"Joining ASUENE allows us to scale our mission faster\u2014to help energy-intensive industries manage carbon as carefully as financial performance,\" said James Carnes , Co-Founder & CEO of Iconic Air, Inc. \"Together, we're building a future where emissions intelligence powers the clean, reliable energy systems needed to meet the growing demands of AI and our global economy.\" Iconic Air Acquisition Background With growing global pressure to reduce GHG emissions, methane management has become a top priority for the oil and gas industry. Methane's warming potential\u2014about 25 times greater than CO\u2082\u2014amplifies the environmental and financial risks of leakage. Tightening regulations such as the U.S. EPA's Subpart W and Europe's upcoming methane rules impose heavy penalties for non-compliance, pushing operators to adopt precise, auditable emissions monitoring systems. ASUENE has pursued a strategic roll-up of leading U.S. climate-tech SaaS companies to build an integrated decarbonization ecosystem. Following its acquisition of NZero in May 2025, the Iconic Air transaction marks the Group's second U.S. M&A this year, underscoring its commitment to scaling advanced data and emissions intelligence solutions. About ASUENE ASUENE Inc. is a leading Climate Tech company committed to driving global efforts toward a net-zero society, providing comprehensive sustainability solutions for businesses on their decarbonization journey.

    "content": "IRVING, Texas , Oct. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC ) (\"CMC\") today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Foley Products Company (\"Foley\"), the largest regional supplier of precast concrete solutions in the United States and leader within the Southeastern U.S., for a cash purchase price of $1.84 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The purchase price represents a multiple of 10.3x Foley's forecasted 2025 EBITDA. When anticipated cash tax benefits are included, the effective multiple is reduced to approximately 9.2x. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per share and free cash flow per share, and by year three annual run-rate synergies are expected in a range of $25 million to $30 million of EBITDA. \"The acquisition of Foley presents a unique opportunity to create immediate scale for our precast platform while adding a best-in-class business with industry-leading margins to CMC's portfolio,\" said Peter Matt, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe precast has significant value creation potential for\u00a0CMC, and the addition of Foley will help unlock further upside from our pending acquisition of CP&P. As a result, we will be even better positioned to bring value to our customers through an expansion of\u00a0CMC's commercial portfolio into mission critical precast applications across a highly complementary footprint in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. Our new precast platform is also expected to transform\u00a0CMC's financial profile, bringing sustainably higher and more stable margins and cash flow, along with significant synergy opportunities as we apply best practices across the network.\" Compelling Strategic and Financial Rationale About Foley Products Company Foley is a leading supplier of precast concrete and pipe products to the Southeast region, with additional presence in the Central and Western U.S. The company operates 18 facilities across nine states. Foley offers one of the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions in the industry and its products are critical in drainage, water management, dry utility, and road construction applications across residential infrastructure, non-residential, and infrastructure end markets. The company is widely recognized for its leading capabilities in design, engineering, manufacturing efficiency, and quality \u2013 attributes that have propelled its growth into the largest regional precast company in the U.S. Foley Products Company was founded in 1981 by Frank Foley. About Precast Concrete and Concrete Pipe Products Precast concrete and concrete pipe products are construction components formed by pouring concrete into a reusable mold, then curing it in a controlled manufacturing environment. The component is then transported in its final form to a construction site for installation. This process produces durable, ready-to-use components of reliable quality that can be installed quickly, saving time, and requiring less labor than pour-in-place techniques. Precast concrete and concrete pipe serve mission-critical applications often for site infrastructure such as utility connections, water supply, or stormwater management. Precast solutions are used widely across each region of the United States, with domestic industry revenues of approximately $30 billion. Transaction Details The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of Commercial Metals Company and Foley Products Company. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in a timely manner following customary regulatory review and is subject to customary closing conditions. The Company has obtained a commitment for financing to complete the transaction. Advisors Moelis & Company LLC served as the exclusive financial advisor and Akin Gump served as legal counsel to CMC for this transaction. Conference Call Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC ) will host a conference call to discuss this announcement, as well as the Company's fourth quarter financial results. CMC invites you to listen to its conference call that will be broadcast live over the internet today, October 16, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central) with Peter Matt, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Lawrence, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

However, they began to experience serious trouble and ultimately closed down after being unable to recover following operational and financial pressures from a high value theft last year. \"This acquisition allows us to combine Luxe Collective's cultural relevance and strong community with FASHIONPHILE's scale, technology, and authentication expertise,\" said Ben Hemminger, Co-Founder and CEO of FASHIONPHILE. \"The UK has a rich history of luxury resale, but no one is doing it our way at real scale. Together with Ben and Joe Gallagher, we intend to change that.\" Luxe Collective's founders will join FASHIONPHILE to lead FASHIONPHILE UK, with Luxe Collective's existing social media channels evolving into \"FASHIONPHILE Collective\" and operations building toward the opening of a London flagship authentication center and store. FASHIONPHILE will bring its extensive catalog of ultra-luxury accessories to UK customers, and for the first time, will begin buying directly from UK customers who are eager to get paid upfront for their luxury accessories. \"Luxe Collective has always been about more than resale. Ben and Joe have built a real community that connects with luxury in a fresh and authentic way,\" said Sarah Davis, Founder and President of FASHIONPHILE. \"The hardships they faced last year were heartbreaking not only for Joe and Ben, but also their entire community. We could not be more thrilled to help bring a breath of life back into the essence of what Ben & Joe Gallagher started. This is about preserving their voice and giving it the resources to thrive on an international stage.\" Since its founding in 2018, Luxe Collective has grown into one of the UK's most influential resale voices, building a loyal community of millions of followers across social platforms and driving awareness of preowned luxury among a new generation of consumers. \"FASHIONPHILE shares our vision for what luxury resale in the UK can become. With their technology, scale and support, we can now realize that vision on a much larger scale,\" said Joe Gallagher, co-founder of Luxe Collective who will serve as Director of Operations at FASHIONPHILE UK. \"From day one, Luxe Collective has been about building community and creating a conversation around luxury that feels inclusive and exciting,\" added Ben Gallagher, co-founder of Luxe Collective, who will take on the role of Director of Brand Marketing at FASHIONPHILE UK. \"With FASHIONPHILE, we now have the chance to bring that spirit to a global audience while staying true to the values that made our community so loyal from the start.\" This acquisition builds on FASHIONPHILE's recent momentum in expanding its omnichannel and international wholesale presence. In late 2023, the company acquired the brand assets of LXRandCo, Inc., Canada's leading pre-owned luxury omnichannel retailer, strengthening its presence in B2B wholesale and laying the groundwork for new retail partnerships. In 2024, FASHIONPHILE further expanded its wholesale reach through the acquisition of Montreal-based Two Authenticators Inc. (\"2a\"), a distributor of authenticated luxury vintage, bringing onboard industry veteran Fred Mannella to lead the company's wholesale division. Together, these moves have positioned FASHIONPHILE at the forefront of omnichannel luxury resale, with a rapidly growing wholesale footprint now spanning North America, Europe, and beyond. ABOUT FASHIONPHILE Founded in 1999, FASHIONPHILE was the very first ultra-luxury re-commerce brand of its kind. More than 25 years later, the company has become the country's largest resale platform for buying and selling ultra-luxury, pre-owned accessories including Chanel, Herm\u00e8s, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. Excelling in digital and omnichannel experiences as well as luxury in-person services, FASHIONPHILE is recognized for its never-ending inventory of the most coveted handbags and accessories, a direct buyout model and best-in-class authentication. Through proprietary, leading-edge technologies and the forging of strategic partnerships, FASHIONPHILE continues to accelerate the luxury lifecycle to a velocity unparalleled to anywhere else in the world. In 2019, FASHIONPHILE became the exclusive re-commerce partner of Neiman Marcus. FASHIONPHILE has flagships in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Diego, CA, and retail locations across the country in Scottsdale, AZ, Newport Beach, CA, Irvine, CA, San Francisco, CA, and Los Angeles, CA, Austin, TX and Philadelphia, PA.

(NYSE: PII ) (\"Polaris\" or \"the Company\") today announced its decision to separate Indian Motorcycle (\"the Business\") from its portfolio and into a standalone business. The Company has entered into a definitive agreement to sell a majority stake in Indian Motorcycle to Carolwood LP, an independent private equity firm founded in 2014 and headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Indian Motorcycle contributed approximately $478 million, or 7.0%, of Polaris' revenues for the trailing twelve-month period ended June 30, 2025. Upon close, the transaction is expected to be accretive to Polaris' annualized adjusted EBITDA by approximately $50 million and to adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\") by approximately $1.00. The close of the transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2026, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. Polaris is confident in Indian Motorcycle's future success under Carolwood ownership and will maintain a small equity position in the Business after the transaction closes. Additional terms of the deal were not disclosed. \"Polaris and Indian Motorcycle both stand to benefit from this deal, which will enable each business to move faster, deliver industry-leading innovation, and lean further into our respective market strengths,\" said Polaris Chief Executive Officer Mike Speetzen. \"For Polaris, the sale will further strengthen our focus on the areas of our portfolio that offer the strongest growth potential and allow us to accelerate investments in key initiatives and create wins with customers and dealers. It also will unlock greater long-term value for Polaris and our shareholders, with immediate value creation that we expect will become increasingly meaningful over time.\" Speetzen continued, \"Under Polaris' ownership and investment, Indian Motorcycle has been re-established as a celebrated brand and major player in the global motorcycle market. With its current product portfolio, global dealer network, category expertise and manufacturing resources, the Business is well positioned to succeed as a standalone company with a dedicated focus on its industry. We were highly intentional and selective in our search and planning efforts for Indian Motorcycle's next chapter of growth. In Carolwood, Indian Motorcycle has a partner that believes in building on the Business' current momentum and supporting its next stage of success. We are confident and committed to making this a seamless transition for Indian Motorcycle dealers, customers and employees.\" \"Indian Motorcycle is an iconic brand built on American heritage, craftsmanship, and most importantly, a community of riders,\" said Andrew Shanfeld, Principal at Carolwood. \"We're honored to help usher in its next chapter as an independent company and to support its continued growth as a symbol of performance and pride. At Carolwood, we target iconic brands that we can passionately impact. Indian Motorcycle allows us to do just that.\" Future Indian Motorcycle Leadership Carolwood has selected Mike Kennedy to serve as CEO of the new independent Indian Motorcycle organization once the deal closes. A more than 30-year motorcycle industry veteran, Kennedy has a proven track record as a leader in and around the motorcycle industry. He previously served as CEO of RumbleOn, the nation's largest powersports dealership group; CEO and President of Vance & Hines, a leading manufacturer of high-performance aftermarket motorcycle exhaust systems and accessories; and spent 26 years at Harley-Davidson in various leadership roles. Adam Rubin, Principal at Carolwood, said, \"Indian Motorcycle has defined American motorcycling for over a century, and Carolwood's role is to ensure that legacy thrives for the next hundred years. Mike Kennedy brings over 30 years of experience leading iconic motorcycle and performance brands and will play a critical role in stewarding Indian Motorcycle's growth. At Carolwood, we're deeply committed to preserving what makes Indian Motorcycle special, supporting its growth, and empowering the team to write its next great chapter.\" Continuity for Indian Motorcycle As a part of the deal, approximately 900 employees will transition as a part of the new Indian Motorcycle Company. Indian Motorcycle will retain the majority of its team, including engineers, designers and staff, along with manufacturing resources. Manufacturing facilities in Spirit Lake, Iowa, and Monticello, Minn., as well as the industrial design and technology center in Burgdorf, Switzerland, will transition to the new standalone motorcycle company as a part of the deal. Indian Motorcycle will continue to provide sales, service, and support for dealers and customers throughout this transition. After the sale is finalized, Indian Motorcycle will operate independently of Polaris and continue selling motorcycles and parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) and providing service through its global Indian Motorcycle dealer network. Polaris Leadership Update Until the transaction closes, Polaris President of On Road and International Mike Dougherty will continue to lead the On Road and International businesses, including Indian Motorcycle, at Polaris. Over the next several months, he will help shepherd Indian Motorcycle in its transition to becoming a standalone company. Dougherty , with a distinguished nearly 28-year career with Polaris, has announced his intent to retire upon the closing of the transaction. \"During his tenure with Polaris, Mike's passionate leadership is responsible for countless contributions. As a result of his tenacity and guidance, Mike shaped our international business into what it is today, scaling it over the last 25 years and establishing a direct presence in more than fifteen countries. He has expanded our business outside of North America, growing revenue from under $100 million in 2000 to more than $1 billion today, as well as strengthened our On Road businesses within their respective markets, including Indian Motorcycle achieving the No. 1 market share position in the United States for mid-size cruisers last year,\" said Speetzen. \"More than that, Mike is known for the teams he builds, the talent he cultivates and the culture he fosters, and I want to thank Mike for his dedication to Polaris all these years. We wish him the very best in his future retirement.\" Preliminary View of Polaris Third Quarter Earnings Results The Company is scheduled to publish its third quarter 2025 results on Tuesday, October 28, 2025. At that time, management will provide additional details regarding today's announced transaction and quarterly performance. Commenting on preliminary Third Quarter results, Speetzen said: \"As we prepare to report our third quarter results, we're encouraged by improving retail trends with ORV ex-Youth up low double digits and continued strong share gains in ORV. Based on preliminary data, we expect third quarter sales to be at the high end of our previously issued guidance range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We anticipate third quarter adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.41, which is meaningfully higher than our original expectations, driven by higher-than-expected shipments, strong cost management and ongoing progress within our operational efficiency initiatives.\" Polaris' estimates for the three months ended September 30, 2025 are preliminary and represent the most current information available to its management. Polaris' actual results may differ from the preliminary estimates due to the completion of its financial closing procedures, final adjustments and other developments that may arise between the date of this press release and the time that financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2025 are finalized. Advisors Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is serving as financial advisor, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison LLP is serving as legal advisor to Polaris. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP is serving as legal advisor to Carolwood LP. Carolwood is also being advised by RSM, Alliant, and Finnea Group.

    "content": "Acquisition strengthens the Brazilian company's presence in Europe and consolidates its growth strategy through technology, data, and operational intelligence S\u00c3O PAULO , Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Inwave, a Brazilian retail tech company, announced the acquisition of Swedish Gateway, a traditional provider of electronic article surveillance (EAS) solutions for retail chains. Founded in 1994, Gateway is present in more than 120 countries through a network of 70 distributors and is recognized for its technical expertise and legacy in the international retail sector. This move is part of Inwave's internationalization strategy. Already exporting 40% of its hardware, Inwave is globally recognized for its expertise and now embarks on a new cycle of international growth, combining organic expansion with the integration of its AIoT platform. With the acquisition, Gateway's technology will be strengthened with connectivity and data intelligence embedded in Inwave's solutions. Inwave will now operate from two bases \u2014 Brazil and Europe \u2014 while retaining Gateway's local team in Sweden, including partner and executive Jenny Tielman. The operation will also be reinforced by Inwave's hardware and software development teams, enabling expansion into strategic markets and replicating Inwave's growth model in Brazil: transitioning from hardware manufacturing to integrated retail tech with a focus on AIoT, big data, RFID, real-time analytics for retail. \"We are combining complementary expertise to accelerate a more connected, efficient, and data-driven retail model. The addition of Gateway strengthens our global presence with a legacy brand that is technically and commercially respected. This is the same path we began five years ago in Brazil, and now we are taking it to Europe,\" said Rubens Bulgarelli Filho, General Manager at Inwave. From hardware manufacturer to retail tech reference Over the past five years, Inwave has multiplied its revenue sevenfold, becoming one of the leading retail tech companies in Latin America. In 2021, the company began its strategic shift toward integrated solutions. In 2024, it consolidated its portfolio by launching the Darwin platform, focused on three pillars: loss prevention, operational efficiency, and improved customer experience. The Darwin platform is already in pilot at one of the largest supermarket chains in France, while in Brazil, proof of concept initiatives showed a 99% conversion rate. Based on this performance, Inwave projects 300% growth in licensing contract bookings over the next 12 months. This capability and innovative approach have led Inwave to deliver projects recognized by two of the world's largest CCTV manufacturers. It also reinforces the company's already significant presence, with more than 8,000 connected points of sale, complemented by Gateway's reach across more than 40,000 stores worldwide. Growth with a solid foundation and international support With hundreds of users around the world, Inwave serves retailers from multiple segments, including Auchan, Carrefour, C&A, Continente (Sonae), Cencosud, Falabella, Lacoste, Leroy Merlin, Leclerc, New Balance, Nike, North Face, Printemps, Sephora. The acquisition, which included participation from Danish fund DSG, supports Inwave's growth as a global reference in retail intelligence and backs the renewal of Gateway, ensuring the company continues to expand its role as a trusted technology provider for retailers globally. \"My experience in global retail has shown me that challenges such as losses, operational inefficiencies, and rising costs are surprisingly universal. What differentiates Inwave is its holistic approach: the combination of cutting-edge technology with smart operational strategies that not only reduce losses and optimize processes but also enhance customer service and loyalty. I see a huge opportunity to expand these innovations into international markets,\" said Tom Christensen, Danish executive and spokesperson for DSG. With the acquisition of Gateway, the Brazilian company strengthens its position as a retail tech and accelerates its international expansion strategy.

    "content": "LIVERMORE, Calif. , Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Precision Cell Systems (PCS) today announced the acquisition of BennuBio, marking a significant entry into the rapidly growing 3D cell culture market. According to Grand View Research, the global market was valued at over $1.7 billion and is projected to exceed $3.2 billion by 2030. The acquisition brings BennuBio's Velocyt\u2122 imaging flow cytometer into the PCS portfolio, expanding the company's capabilities in single-cell analysis, cell therapy, drug discovery, and bioprocessing applications. BennuBio is a New Mexico-based life science company that has developed an imaging flow cytometer for high-throughput analysis of 3D multicellular models including spheroids, organoids, and stem cell aggregates. The Velocyt platform addresses a critical unmet need by rapidly characterizing large particles beyond the capabilities of standard flow cytometry while enabling complete sample recovery for downstream analysis. \"The next wave of therapies will rely on complex 3D cell models, but the analytical tools have lagged behind,\" said Anup Parikh, PhD, CEO of Precision Cell Systems. \"BennuBio's technology allows researchers to rapidly analyze intact samples at scale and then recover them for further analysis, kinetic studies, or continued growth. This acquisition positions PCS to deliver a seamless workflow that connects complex 3D models with single-cell insights.\" \"The Velocyt has allowed us to study nanoparticle uptake and immune cell penetration in intact cancer spheroids at an unprecedented scale. In just minutes, we can evaluate hundreds of thousands of multicellular clusters and recover them intact for downstream analysis. This technology is transforming how we approach complex 3D tumor biology,\" said Rita Serda, PhD, Associate Professor at the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center and Velocyt customer. \"I'm incredibly proud of the progress our team made in advancing 3D multicellular analysis,\" said John O'Rourke, former CEO of BennuBio. \"Joining PCS provides the operational scale and workflow integration needed to realize the full potential of this technology and accelerate its impact for researchers globally.\" O'Rourke will join PCS along with BennuBio co-founder Travis Woods to lead the integration and continued development of the Velocyt platform. The acquisition also strengthens PCS's financial position with the addition of Tramway Ventures, BennuBio's lead investor, to its syndicate. \"We have seen the immense potential in BennuBio's technology to solve critical problems in 3D biology, and we are thrilled to see it find a strategic home with PCS,\" said Wanetta Tuttle, Managing Partner at Tramway Ventures. \"Joining Precision Cell Systems provides the commercial and operational infrastructure needed to scale this technology and get it into the hands of customers who need it most. We are excited to join the PCS syndicate and support their proven consolidation strategy.\" This marks PCS's third acquisition in 2025, following the additions of S2 Genomics and ORFLO, demonstrating momentum in executing its consolidation strategy. Building on this progress, the company is actively pursuing additional acquisitions, targeting complementary technologies for sample preparation, functional cellular and molecular assays, to build a comprehensive cell analysis workflow platform.

    "content": "NEW YORK , Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Ether Machine, Inc., a planned public company following a pending business combination with Dynamix Corporation (Nasdaq: ETHM ) (\"Dynamix\") and The Ether Reserve LLC, announced today that it has accrued 1,350 net new ether ( ETH ) as yield (currently valued at approximately $5.6M) through its actively managed ETH staking strategy. 1 These rewards were generated at some of the lowest costs in the industry due to the Ether Machine's vertical integration, which spares shareholders from the asset management fees charged to other digital asset treasury companies. The Ether Reserve's treasury is fully staked onchain, with validators consistently ranked among the top 5% for staking reward efficiency across its active validator set, meaning the ETH already deployed is generating market-leading yield. \"The Ether Machine was formed by the original believers in the power of Ethereum and ETH as the most attractive, productive asset in the digital economy. Today's staking reward milestone is a validation of our strategy as the best vehicle for institutional-grade public exposure to Ethereum , optimizing yield and continually increasing ETH generation per share,\" said Andrew Keys, Co-Founder and Chairman of The Ether Machine. The Ether Machine is a purpose-built digital asset treasury structured to generate and optimize ETH -denominated yield through staking, restaking, and participating in the broader Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. The Ether Machine's founding team has significant institutional ETH staking experience, including Tim Lowe, Chief Technology Officer of The Ether Machine, who was Head of Staking for Consensys and Chief Technology Officer at DARMA Capital, staking billions of dollars of ETH across roughly 15,000 validators, where they were consistently in the top 5% for yield generation, without ever experiencing a slashing event. On July 21, 2025, The Ether Machine announced $800 million in committed capital from institutional investors and a direct personal contribution from Chairman and Co-Founder Andrew Keys of 169,984 ETH (currently valued at approximately [$712M]). Earlier this month, the company also announced a 150,000 ETH investment (currently valued at approximately [$654M]) by Blockchains Co-Founder Jeffrey Berns, a long-time champion of the Ethereum blockchain. The Ether Machine intends to be the leading institutional holder and advocate of Ethereum assets, committed to accretive capital strategies that increase ETH generation per share over time. The Ether Machine recently announced the confidential submission of a draft registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, retaining KPMG as its auditor. The Ether Machine anticipates the close of its proposed transaction in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Dynamix shareholders.

Expected to be anchored by one of the largest on-chain ETH positions of any public entity, The Ether Machine will actively generate and optimize ETH -denominated returns through staking, restaking, and secure, professionally risk-managed DeFi participation.

The expansion gives institutions access to a focused acquisition lane, typically $20M+ million per asset. \"Over the last six years we've built the team, processes, and operating discipline to repeatedly execute in a space many overlook,\" said Saagar Parikh, President & CIO, Spark GHC. \"We're now inviting institutional partners into that same lane, at scale. This is about evolving our strategy to capture the next cycle of opportunities.\" Spark GHC targets branded select-service hotels with clear operational and capital-improvement upside in growth markets. The firm's value creation strategy leverages proprietary business intelligence systems, centralized revenue management oversight, and standardized renovation planning and execution to drive margin expansion post-acquisition. In addition, Spark GHC will pursue up-branding conversion opportunities, repositioning assets to higher-quality brand flags that capture incremental RevPAR growth and broaden distribution. \"We're not chasing a new fad,\" said Amit Patel, CEO, Spark GHC. \"Our edge is specialization.

    "content": "Multi-national lottery leader to enter United States sports and entertainment industry by purchasing approx. 62.3% of the nation's largest daily fantasy sports platform Transaction implies an upfront enterprise value of USD 2.5 billion for\u00a0PrizePicks Allwyn and PrizePicks will combine strengths to accelerate innovation and fan engagement LUCERNE, Switzerland and ATLANTA , Sept. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allwyn International AG, the lottery-led gaming entertainment company, and PrizePicks, the largest daily fantasy sports (\"DFS\") operator in North America , today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Allwyn to acquire a majority stake in PrizePicks. Allwyn has agreed to\u00a0purchase an approximately 62.3% stake in PrizePicks for an expected initial cash consideration of USD 1.6 billion , implying an upfront enterprise value of USD 2.5 billion . If PrizePicks achieves certain performance metrics over the next three years, additional cash consideration under the agreement could raise the implied enterprise value to a maximum of USD 4.15 billion . Since it was founded in 2015, PrizePicks has become the leader in DFS through industry-leading product innovation and a deep commitment to its player community. PrizePicks has offered fans new ways to engage with their favourite sports \u2013 including free-to-play games and a peer-to-peer tournament-style offering, which enables fans to test their skills against other players. It has attracted a passionate fanbase of millions of monthly active users across more than 45 United States\u00a0jurisdictions and has become one of the fastest-growing DFS operators in the country. The company has consistently delivered high double-digit annual revenue growth and strong profitability . For Allwyn, the transaction is a unique opportunity to enter the strategically important sports and entertainment industry in the United States , expanding its business in the country beyond its existing operation of the Illinois Lottery. With a shared belief in the power of technology and commitment to responsible play and community impact, PrizePicks is highly complementary to Allwyn's expanding portfolio in casual entertainment \u2013 in line with its vision to become the world's leading gaming entertainment company. With Allwyn's scale and resources, PrizePicks will have the support to expand and innovate faster, reaching more fans than ever before. PrizePicks will operate as a standalone brand within Allwyn, led by its CEO Mike Ybarra and the existing leadership team who will be retaining the majority of their existing ownership interest. The company's executive team brings deep expertise from the video game and entertainment industries, with a proven track record of building products that resonate with player communities. Adam Wexler , PrizePicks' co-founder, will continue to serve as a member of the PrizePicks Board of Directors. Transaction Information The expected initial cash consideration for Allwyn's acquisition of an interest of approximately 62.3% in PrizePicks is USD 1.6 billion , subject to customary post-closing adjustments and based on an expectation of nil cash and nil debt at closing [1] . In addition, the selling shareholders of PrizePicks may receive further performance-contingent payments of up to approximately USD 1.0 billion in 2029, based on performance metrics during 2026-28, which could increase the implied enterprise value to a maximum of USD 4.15 billion . Minority shareholders will benefit from certain customary liquidity provisions five years post-closing. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2026, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the notification to and/or approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Allwyn expects to finance the purchase price using a combination of cash on balance sheet and debt financing. PrizePicks generated Adjusted EBITDA [2] of USD 339 million in the 12 months to June 2025 , achieving revenue growth of over 60% year-on-year and delivering strong cash flow generation over the same period. Karel Komarek , Allwyn Founder and Chair, said: \"This acquisition will continue to drive Allwyn's momentum and expand our business in the United States . PrizePicks has established its credentials as an industry pioneer, revolutionising the way fans engage with the athletes they love, making the contests more thrilling and immersive. We are excited to work with PrizePicks to shape the future of this new frontier in casual entertainment.\" Robert Chvatal , Allwyn CEO, added: \"This is a significant European investment, and Allwyn's biggest in the United States to date. PrizePicks is an entrepreneurial company that is empowering a new generation of fans who want to engage with their favourite sports and athletes, not just spectate. PrizePicks has created an intuitive platform that simplifies the process of making skilled predictions. I look forward to partnering with Mike and the PrizePicks team to support the growth of the business.\" Stepan Dlouhy , Allwyn Chief Investment Officer, said: \"The acquisition of PrizePicks underscores our ability to execute on our ambitious investment strategy. The United States gaming and entertainment market has always been a compelling opportunity, and our focus has been on finding the right entry points. We took the first step in 2023 with the acquisition of the operator of the Illinois lottery and were pleased to subsequently acquire a majority stake in IWG, which has a strong footprint in the United States , in 2024. Today, we announce the next major milestone on our journey. PrizePicks fits perfectly into our vision of shaping the future of mass market casual digital entertainment and is poised for further strong growth.\" Mike Ybarra , CEO of PrizePicks, said: \"Today marks the start of an exciting new chapter for PrizePicks and our growing community of players. There has never been a more electrifying time to shape the future of fan-first entertainment. By joining forces with Allwyn, a like-minded and disruptive company that shares our passion for bold product innovation, we will accelerate our mission to make our games more interactive, engaging and rewarding for fans everywhere.\" Adam Wexler , PrizePicks Founder, said: \"From day one, we set out to create a more accessible style of fantasy sports that could appeal to casual players. As the industry evolved, PrizePicks was the first to go all-in on the simplest prediction model and take it to scale, reshaping how fans engage with fantasy sports. Now, with Allwyn's backing, we'll accelerate our vision and bring our games to even more players on a much bigger stage.\" The acquisition of PrizePicks comes at an exciting and transformative time for Allwyn. In 2024, the company completed the acquisition of a 70% stake in leading e-instants supplier Instant Win Gaming and announced an intention to acquire a controlling interest in Novibet, the online sports betting and gaming operator. Alongside the announcement of new global partnerships with Formula 1 and McLaren in early 2025, these transactions increase Allwyn's exposure to fast-growing and opportunity-rich markets\u2013 to the benefit of players and communities alike. Additional Daily Fantasy Sports Information Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) are skill-based games that give fans opportunities to test their sports knowledge in structured contests governed by specific rules and regulations. Unlike sports betting , where outcomes depend on wagering against odds set by bookmakers, DFS requires players to use their expertise \u2014 from analysing player performance to understanding matchups \u2014 to build lineups and compete for prizes. This skills-driven format has become a popular way for fans to engage more deeply with the games they love, creating an interactive second screen experience that complements live sports. PrizePicks was built with this in mind, offering a simple, accessible platform that reflects how today's fans watch sports, consume entertainment and build community. Notes to editors Freshfields US LLP is providing legal advice to Allwyn on this transaction. For PrizePicks, Moelis & Company LLC is acting as financial adviser and Cooley LLP is acting as legal counsel. About PrizePicks \u200dPrizePicks is the largest daily fantasy sports operator in the United States . Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia , PrizePicks offers innovative skill-based fantasy games that engage and excite sports fans nationwide. Operating in more than 45 jurisdictions and continuing to expand, PrizePicks is dedicated to enhancing the sports experience for all. For more information, visit www.prizepicks.com .

    "content": "AMC secures nearly 29,000 acres of ecologically critical forest in Maine's 100-Mile Wilderness GREENVILLE, Maine , Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), the nation's oldest outdoor recreation and conservation organization, announced today that it has completed the acquisition of the Barnard Forest in Maine's 100-Mile Wilderness thanks to a transformative $10 million gift from MathWorks, the leading developer of mathematical computing software. This acquisition secures nearly 29,000 acres of globally significant habitat and marks a major milestone in the Appalachian Mountain Club's landmark Maine Woods Initiative, which now totals 127,710 acres. The gift from MathWorks, the second-largest philanthropic contribution in AMC's history, enabled the organization to finalize its purchase of the Barnard Forest from The Conservation Fund and The Malone Family Land Preservation Foundation years ahead of schedule, accelerating conservation outcomes in one of the most ecologically important landscapes in the eastern United States . \"This gift from MathWorks is more than generous \u2014 it's catalytic,\" said Nicole Zussman , President and CEO of AMC. \"It enables us to safeguard an irreplaceable landscape, ensuring its health, access, and biodiversity are permanently protected. MathWorks has made a profound investment not just in land, but in climate resilience, community opportunity, and ecological continuity. I'm grateful they shared our vision and accelerated our ability to protect this landscape two years faster than we'd even hoped.\" The Barnard Forest, a nearly 29,000-acre working forest in Piscataquis County , lies within the Pleasant River watershed, home to the last naturally reproducing population of landlocked salmon in Maine . The forest includes more than 70 miles of stream corridors, critical spawning grounds for endangered sea-run Atlantic salmon, extensive spruce-fir flats, and associated wetlands that provide cold-water habitat for native brook trout and landlocked smelt. The land protects an uninterrupted, undeveloped forest from the Appalachian Trail highlands to the main stem of the Pleasant River, a total continuous conserved land of over 750,000 acres, nearly the size of the White Mountain National Forest. This conservation milestone was made possible through AMC's strategic partnership with The Conservation Fund. In 2023, The Conservation Fund and The Malone Family Land Preservation Foundation jointly acquired the southern portion of the Barnard property, giving AMC the time needed to raise funds for its permanent protection. The Conservation Fund's share was purchased through its Working Forest Fund, with support from the Richard King Mellon Foundation. Today's announcement brings together the shared vision of multiple partners focused on conservation to permanently protect the property well ahead of schedule. \"This is precisely the type of meaningful, high-impact work The Conservation Fund was created to tackle,\" said Tom Duffus , the Fund's vice president and northeast representative based in Freeport . \"Through swift and strategic action, we collaborated to successfully protect this vital place to create lasting benefits for the great state of Maine , local residents, and this region's many visitors.\" Under the Appalachian Mountain Club's stewardship, the Barnard Forest will support restoration forestry, habitat connectivity, and climate adaptation. The property will be managed to Forest Stewardship Council standards, with plans to rebuild older forest conditions and expand carbon stocking, which is an integral part of the organization's broader climate strategy. The forest also contributes to rural economic growth by helping support more than 50 forestry- and recreation-related jobs and reinforcing the AMC's $8.39 million annual economic impact in the region. The property will remain on the tax rolls of Piscataquis County. \" Barnard represents a true convergence of conservation opportunity, ecological importance, and public benefit,\" added Steve Tatko , Vice President of Land and Conservation for the Appalachian Mountain Club. \"This land was closed to the public for nearly 20 years. Thanks to MathWorks, The Conservation Fund, and countless donors and partners, it will now remain open to future generations for fishing, hunting, recreation, and cultural use, including tribal access. AMC is proud to live its values in a forest like this in service of ecology and people, for the benefit of both.\" Initial funding for this project came from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, the EJK Foundation, and other lead individuals and foundations. AMC's three-year campaign to protect and reopen Barnard Forest resulted in nearly $24 million in gifts, grants, and program-related investments to support the acquisition, perpetual stewardship, and capital necessary to re-establish public access to Barnard Forest. MathWorks completed the purchase of the Barnard Forest with a transformative $10 million donation, part of its commitment to sustainability and science-based climate solutions. \"At MathWorks, we believe in solutions that scale, endure, and benefit both people and the planet,\" said MathWorks SVP and CFO Jeanne O'Keefe . \"Supporting the permanent protection of Barnard Forest reflects this commitment. We're proud to help accelerate the Appalachian Mountain Club's work in the Maine Woods and protect this extraordinary landscape for future generations.\" The Barnard Forest acquisition is part of AMC's Maine Woods Initiative, the largest multi-use conservation and recreation project in the eastern United States . With this addition, the initiative now encompasses nearly 130,000 contiguous acres \u2014 an area nearly three times the size of Acadia National Park . Since its founding in 1876, the Appalachian Mountain Club has led major conservation milestones, including advocacy for the creation of the White Mountain National Forest. Under Nicole Zussman's leadership, the organization is building a bold new legacy, one rooted in science, scaled through partnership, and focused on lasting impact for the land and the people who depend on it.

(CSE: SCPE) (OTCQB: SCPCF ) (FSE: VN8) (\"Scope Technologies\" or the \"Company\") has acquired Plurilock Security Private Limited (\"Cloud Codes\"), an Indian corporation that operates the \"Cloud Codes\", pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Plurilock Security Inc., being a company listed TSX Venture Exchange.\u00a0 Cloud Codes was found in 2011 and has a proven track record in secure Single Sign-On (\"SSO\") and distributed storage solutions. Highlights of the Acquisition: The Cloud Codes acquisition is immediately accretive to Scope Technologies as it adds revenue to the operations of Scope Technologies and the Cloud Codes' middleware will become the centerpiece of QSE's decentralized cloud backbone. Terms of Transaction Under the terms of the Agreement, Scope Technologies acquired Cloud Codes including any other \"Cloud Codes\" assets owned by Plurilock. \u00a0In consideration of the foregoing, the Company paid Plurilock CAD $100,000 and issued a total of 4,200,000 common shares to Plurilock (the \"Consideration Shares\") at a deemed price of $0.40 per share.\u00a0 The total consideration for Cloud Codes is CAD $1,780,000 .

Integration Plans of Cloud Codes Scope Technologies plans to rebrand the Cloud Codes platform under the QSE name and prioritized for seamless integration into the QSE product stack. \u00a0Future releases are expected to include quantum-secure SSO services bundled with storage offerings, targeting regulated enterprises, banking, healthcare, and organizations requiring long-term data integrity. Over the coming months, Scope Technologies intends to provide further updates on enterprise-grade product tiers, compliance certifications, and expanded features such as identity federation, MFA, and cryptographic key rotation tailored for post-quantum assurance. As NIST ratified quantum-resistant encryption standards (CRYSTALS-Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+) in 2024 and began updating others in 2025\u20132026, market readiness is accelerating. Meanwhile, leading vendors are embedding post-quantum cryptography into Zero-Trust and VPN products, highlighting the urgent need for quantum-safe identity management solutions. Scope Technologies' planned vertical ownership of both quantum-secure infrastructure and identity lifecycle management would position it ahead of traditional SSO vendors and among the first enterprises offering lag-free, post-quantum authentication at scale.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. and HAWTHORNE, Calif. , Sept. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0EchoStar has entered into a definitive agreement with SpaceX to sell the company's AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses for approximately $17 billion , consisting of up to $8.5 billion in cash and up to $8.5 billion in SpaceX stock valued as of the entry into the definitive agreement. Additionally, the definitive agreement provides for SpaceX to fund an aggregate of approximately $2 billion of cash interest payments payable on EchoStar debt through November of 2027. In connection with the transaction, SpaceX and EchoStar will enter into a long-term commercial agreement, which will enable EchoStar's Boost Mobile subscribers \u2013 through its cloud-native 5G core \u2013 to access SpaceX's next generation Starlink Direct to Cell service. \"For the past decade, we've acquired spectrum and facilitated worldwide 5G spectrum standards and devices, all with the foresight that direct-to-cell connectivity via satellite would change the way the world communicates,\" said Hamid Akhavan , president & CEO, EchoStar. \"This transaction with SpaceX continues our legacy of putting the customer first as it allows for the combination of AWS-4 and H-block spectrum from EchoStar with the rocket launch and satellite capabilities from SpaceX to realize the direct-to-cell vision in a more innovative, economical and faster way for consumers worldwide.\" \"We're so pleased to be doing this transaction with EchoStar as it will advance our mission to end mobile dead zones around the world,\" said Gwynne Shotwell , president & COO, SpaceX. \"SpaceX's first generation Starlink satellites with Direct to Cell capabilities have already connected millions of people when they needed it most \u2013 during natural disasters so they could contact emergency responders and loved ones \u2013 or when they would have previously been off the grid.

Founded in 2018 by Ruben Harris , Timur Meyster , and Artur Meyster , Career Karma has guided over 100 million visitors toward upskilling resources and helped thousands land roles in technology. With this acquisition, Climb will carry forward Career Karma's mission while expanding its reach into new, high-demand industries. \"For over a decade, Climb has worked to remove financial, informational, and motivational barriers to career education,\" said Casey Powers , CEO of Climb Credit . \"This acquisition isn't just about scaling \u2014 it's about impact. We're building a platform that serves students across many different industries, from healthcare to the skilled trades, reflecting the diverse opportunities learners are pursuing today. Together, we're helping learners not only finance their education but confidently choose the right path for their future.\" A shared mission to support the learner journey Climb and Career Karma have both been built on a belief that access to career-aligned education can change lives. For many prospective students, the hardest part isn't just paying for school. It's knowing where to start, how to choose the right program, or how to get through the application process. Schools want to help, but often lack the bandwidth to guide every student through that discovery phase. By combining their strengths, Climb and Career Karma will offer: \"When determining the best future for the Career Karma platform, we were excited by the alignment that Climb has with our core mission,\" said Ruben Harris , Founder of Career Karma. \"We're looking forward to seeing how they expand what we built into the many career paths that they support with their other products.\" Experienced leadership to drive the next chapter To lead Career Karma's next chapter, Climb tapped Jeff Herbst , a seasoned marketing executive with a track record in student recruitment. Jeff has held leadership roles at Noodle and 2U and most recently founded Protostar Studio to help schools profitably grow student enrollments. He brings deep expertise in organic media, performance marketing, and enrollment management. \"We have an opportunity to expand the impact of the Career Karma platform, with the student at the center,\" said Jeff Herbst . \"We're focused on helping people find the right program and the support they need to get started. And we're doing it in a way that also makes it easier for schools to achieve their enrollment objectives.\" Strategic value for schools For career training providers, the new Career Karma platform will offer: TripleTen , an online coding bootcamp for career changers that offers flexible, beginner-friendly programs to help anyone become a job-ready tech professional, has partnered with Career Karma to pilot this new offering. \"Finding the right training partner and getting ready for enrollment has always been a challenge for students looking to start their new careers. We are excited to partner with Career Karma and Climb Credit on this innovative approach that makes bootcamp education more accessible and effective,\" said TripleTen CDPO, Russell Ramesh . A Platform with Momentum and a Vision for the Future This acquisition builds on Climb's ongoing investment in creating an end-to-end support ecosystem for students and schools. While financing will remain separate from the Career Karma discovery experience, Climb's broader vision continues to be shaped by a deep understanding of the barriers students face\u2014financial and otherwise\u2014and how to remove them thoughtfully. About Climb Credit Climb (NMLS# 1240013) is a student payment platform that helps make career-focused education more accessible and affordable.

    "content": "New institution is now third-largest public research university in Texas SAN ANTONIO , Sept. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0UTSA and The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) today merged to form The University of Texas at San Antonio (UT San Antonio ), a premier global university that is deeply committed to making lives better for the communities it serves. As a merged institution, UT San Antonio now ranks as the third-largest public research university in Texas according to annual research expenditures, behind only Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin . UT San Antonio's comprehensive enterprise now includes approximately 40,000 students, 17,000 employees and more than $486 million in annual research expenditures. Its growing endowment tops $1.3 billion . The merger joins two Carnegie R1 (\"very high research activity\") universities, an elite designation reserved for the top 5% of research institutions in United States , and represents the nation's largest integration of universities by total research dollars and endowment since 2013. UT San Antonio will immediately deliver immense value to students, researchers, alumni and partners, said President Taylor Eighmy . He envisions it will serve as an exemplar for The University of Texas System, the state of Texas and the nation. \"We intentionally grounded UT San Antonio in excellence \u2014 excellence in education, healthcare, transdisciplinary research and discovery \u2014 to form a model public research university that is nimble, creative and unlike any other,\" said\u00a0Eighmy. \"With that spirit of excellence, we've combined two distinguished Tier One institutions to form a new world-class university that champions social mobility, improves health and powers discovery to amplify our collective strengths and create impact at scale.\" UT San Antonio's breadth and scope Building on the rich history of UTSA and UT Health San Antonio, UT San Antonio will advance knowledge through teaching and learning, groundbreaking research and scientific innovation, exceptional patient care and deep community engagement. Spanning 15 colleges and schools across six campuses, UT San Antonio now offers more than 320 highly competitive undergraduate and graduate degrees and certificates, one of the most comprehensive academic portfolios in the state. UT San Antonio students have access to an education of the highest quality in disciplines ranging from science, engineering, business, education, humanities, social sciences, architecture and the arts to biomedical sciences, medicine, public health, dentistry, nursing and other allied health professions. The university's academic and research programs are ranked among the top 3% worldwide, according to the Center for University World Rankings. The institution is also in the top 12% of colleges and universities in the nation for social mobility, according to The Wall Street Journal and College Pulse. Additionally, its Executive MBA program is ranked 3 rd in the U.S. by CEO Magazine. UT San Antonio includes UT San Antonio Health Science Center, the region's only academic health center and a globally leading health sciences institution, ranked in the top 2.4% of universities worldwide in the 2025 Center for World University Rankings, reaffirming its position as a global leader in biomedical discovery and innovation. UT San Antonio's Health Science Center is ranked 84 th out of 5,868 healthcare institutions around the world and 38 th in the United States in the 2025 Nature Index of healthcare institutions for research output. This places the institution among the top 2% of healthcare institutes globally. UT Health San Antonio, the clinical and patient-care enterprise of UT San Antonio , sees more than 2.5 million patient visits each year and brings together expertise across more than 200 medical and dental specialties and subspecialties\u2014addressing everything from common conditions to complex diseases that disproportionately affect Texans. Through this work, the institution delivers life-changing impact for individuals and families across South Texas' 38-county region. Each year, UT Health San Antonio educates and trains more than 1,015 residents, fellows, and trainees, creating a vital pipeline of skilled physicians to serve our communities. With a team of more than 1,400 physicians, medical providers, health professionals and researchers, the institution provides essential coverage and strengthens the healthcare workforce that supports the region's major health care networks\u2014including University Health and the Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans' Hospital, part of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS). These deeply integrated partnerships not only elevate the quality of patient care today but also ensure that the health needs of our rapidly growing region and state are met with innovation and expertise. Building on its combined capabilities, UT San Antonio leaders envision rapid development of hands-on learning opportunities and new degree programs, much like the 2023 launch of a dual degree program in medicine and artificial intelligence, which was the first program of its kind in the United States . \"Synergies of expertise that come together allow us to innovate. That's going to be available now to students, to faculty, to scientists, to graduate students across the spectrum of this new university,\" said Francisco G. Cigarroa , MD , who serves as senior executive vice president for health affairs and health system of UT San Antonio . \"A discovery that happens here, that improves the quality of life, not only improves the quality of life for our children or for our loved ones, but that translates to the population at large and it's going to have a global impact.\" Athletics remain key to UT San Antonio's vibrant culture. In all 17 NCAA Division I sports, student-athletes will continue to compete as UTSA in the American Conference. The school's beloved mascot, Rowdy the Roadrunner, also remains central to UT San Antonio's university spirit and growing footprint. Growing Texas' economy UT San Antonio is projected to have a $7 billion annual economic impact, energizing San Antonio's $44.1 billion healthcare and biosciences sector, the city's largest industry. The university\u00a0will play a critical role in advancing regional prosperity by fostering excellence, building a culture of service and creating transformative opportunities that keep graduates in Texas , fulfilling its promise to provide talent for industry's most in-demand, future-forward jobs. Institutional data shows that more than 90% of UTSA's alumni enter and remain in the Texas workforce, and UT San Antonio graduates and trains the majority of South Texas' doctors, nurses, dentists, allied health providers and biomedical scientists. Building on that momentum, Eighmy says that UT San Antonio has the potential to become \"one of the most consequential and forward-thinking universities in the United States .\" Cigarroa added, \"UT San Antonio is going to enrich that culture that makes San Antonio \u2013 the region that we live in \u2013 not only the best place to raise a family but the best place to study and the best place to work. Education saves lives. For me, it's the greatest public health initiative we can provide because we can transform one life that will change generations to come.\" An ambitious vision within reach In addition to bringing about interdisciplinary synergies in research and educational opportunities for both students and faculty, today's merger completion puts UT San Antonio on a very real path to becoming a premier institution with the characteristics of the elite members of the Association of American Universities. \"I cannot overstate the significance of what this new UT San Antonio will mean to Texas and the nation,\" said UT System Board of Regents chairman Kevin Eltife . \"This is and always will be about impact. It's about bringing together two institutions that complement each other - one with academics, research, the arts, and athletics and another that has all that you could ask for to make patients' lives better through health education, research, and clinical care.\" About UT San Antonio The University of Texas at San Antonio (UT San Antonio ) is a nationally recognized, top-tier public research university that unites the power of higher education, biomedical discovery, and healthcare within one visionary institution.

    "content": "La sortie, \u00e0 une valeur de 1,5 milliard de dollars, marque le plus grand retour jamais r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par BGF et souligne l'importance du capital patient dans l'expansion de l'innovation m\u00e9dicale au Royaume-Uni. LONDON , 25 ao\u00fbt 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BGF, l'investisseur en capital de croissance le plus actif du Royaume-Uni et d'Irlande, annonce aujourd'hui la sortie r\u00e9ussie d'OrganOx, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de technologie m\u00e9dicale bas\u00e9e \u00e0 Oxford dont la technologie pionni\u00e8re de perfusion du foie a transform\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats pour les patients transplant\u00e9s dans le monde entier. Cette op\u00e9ration repr\u00e9sente l'une des plus importantes sorties d'une entreprise britannique de technologie m\u00e9dicale, avec un montant de 1,5 milliard de dollars (la valeur totale de la transaction est d'environ 1,5 milliard de dollars). Il s'agit \u00e9galement du plus grand retour jamais r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par BGF, qui a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 175 millions de livres sterling de recettes. L'op\u00e9ration a permis de multiplier par 10 le multiple mon\u00e9taire de l'investissement initial de BGF et d'obtenir un taux de rendement interne global de l'ordre de 69 %. BGF a investi pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans OrganOx en 2019 et a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 sept tours d'investissement, dont un engagement de 20 millions de livres sterling au d\u00e9but de cette ann\u00e9e. BGF a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun des cycles de financement qui ont suivi son investissement initial et est le principal actionnaire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Longwall Ventures et Oxford Investment Consultants comptent parmi les autres premiers bailleurs de fonds de l'entreprise. Au cours des derni\u00e8res \u00e9tapes du d\u00e9veloppement, OrganOx a eu la chance d'attirer des capitaux de Lauxera Capital Partners (US/Fr), HealthQuest (US) et d'autres qui ont apport\u00e9 leur soutien. Fond\u00e9e par l' University of Oxford , OrganOx a mis au point le premier dispositif enti\u00e8rement automatis\u00e9 de conservation du foie, metra , qui permet de maintenir le foie des donneurs en \u00e9tat de fonctionnement en dehors du corps humain pendant une p\u00e9riode pouvant aller jusqu'\u00e0 24 heures. Cette technologie, utilis\u00e9e dans plus de 6 000 greffes de foie \u00e0 ce jour, a permis d'augmenter consid\u00e9rablement le nombre d'organes viables disponibles pour la transplantation et d'am\u00e9liorer les r\u00e9sultats pour les patients. Gr\u00e2ce au soutien de BGF, OrganOx est devenue une entreprise de technologie m\u00e9dicale de premier plan. Apr\u00e8s la finalisation de la transaction, l'entreprise continuera \u00e0 op\u00e9rer \u00e0 partir d' Oxford en tant que division autonome au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mondiale de soins de sant\u00e9 Terumo Corporation. Tim Rea , coresponsable des investissements en phase de d\u00e9marrage chez BGF et membre du conseil d'administration d'OrganOx depuis 2019, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab OrganOx a transform\u00e9 la transplantation h\u00e9patique et a construit une position de classe mondiale dans la medtech. Dans un secteur o\u00f9 les capitaux institutionnels sont limit\u00e9s, cette sortie souligne l'importance et le potentiel d'un capital de croissance patient et d'une volont\u00e9 de soutenir l'innovation avant qu'elle ne soit d\u00e9pourvue de risques - ce que de nombreux investisseurs ont du mal \u00e0 faire sur ce march\u00e9 encore naissant \u00bb. \u00ab BGF a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour d\u00e9ployer des capitaux dans des secteurs mal desservis du march\u00e9 de l'investissement. Dans le domaine des technologies m\u00e9dicales en phase de d\u00e9marrage, nous sommes all\u00e9s plus loin en soutenant d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment des entreprises dont le mat\u00e9riel et la fabrication sont tr\u00e8s complexes. Notre capital et notre expertise commerciale nous ont plac\u00e9s dans une position id\u00e9ale pour relever ce d\u00e9fi et OrganOx est un exemple puissant de l'importance de cette strat\u00e9gie \u00bb. Oern R. Stuge MD, MBA, et pr\u00e9sident ex\u00e9cutif d'OrganOx a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab La transaction annonc\u00e9e aujourd'hui devrait permettre d'\u00e9largir l'adoption de notre plate-forme technologique de transplantation en tirant parti de l'infrastructure mondiale de Terumo pour en faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier davantage de patients dans le monde entier. \u00ab Merci \u00e0 BGF qui a fait preuve de conviction et de soutien en tant qu'investisseur et membre du conseil d'administration depuis son premier investissement. Leur capital et leur leadership ont permis la cr\u00e9ation de valeur inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la transaction de $1.5bn annonc\u00e9e aujourd'hui \u00bb. Andy Gregory , directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de BGF, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab Nous sommes incroyablement fiers d'avoir jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 dans l'une des plus importantes sorties de fonds dans le domaine de la technologie m\u00e9dicale au Royaume-Uni, avec une valorisation \u00e0 dix chiffres. Il s'agit d'une r\u00e9ussite remarquable de l'\u00e9quipe d'OrganOx, et nous sommes particuli\u00e8rement fiers que ce succ\u00e8s soit directement li\u00e9 \u00e0 un impact positif sur les r\u00e9sultats pour les patients. \u00ab En combinant des investissements en phase de d\u00e9marrage et de croissance dans plusieurs secteurs, BGF a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le bon m\u00e9lange pour offrir des rendements solides, durables et reproductibles. Notre ambition est maintenant d'accro\u00eetre les flux de capitaux vers les entreprises britanniques les plus prometteuses, que ce soit par le biais de co-investissements avec des investisseurs internationaux et sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, ou par des sources nationales \u00bb. Outre OrganOx, BGF a soutenu plusieurs entreprises britanniques \u00e0 fort potentiel dans le domaine des technologies m\u00e9dicales, notamment Cyted, qui utilise des diagnostics bas\u00e9s sur l'AI-enabled pour la d\u00e9tection pr\u00e9coce du cancer ; TidalSense, qui d\u00e9veloppe une technologie innovante de surveillance respiratoire ; et Entia, une plateforme d'analyse sanguine \u00e0 domicile qui soutient les soins en canc\u00e9rologie. Cette op\u00e9ration fait suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9cente sortie de BGF de Panthera Biopartners, une organisation de gestion de sites d'essais cliniques de premier plan. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode d'investissement de BGF, le chiffre d'affaires de Panthera a plus que doubl\u00e9 et l'entreprise a \u00e9largi son empreinte nationale et sa couverture th\u00e9rapeutique. BGF est l'un des investisseurs en capital de croissance les plus importants et les plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s du Royaume-Uni et de l'Irlande. Il soutient les entrepreneurs et les innovateurs, en fournissant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des investissements initiaux compris entre 3 et 30 millions de livres sterling dans des entreprises \u00e0 fort potentiel. BGF s'est r\u00e9cemment engag\u00e9 \u00e0 verser 500 millions de livres sterling \u00e0 des entreprises de haute technologie et de sciences de la vie en phase de d\u00e9marrage, dans le cadre de sa strat\u00e9gie plus large de 3 milliards de livres sterling \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du Royaume-Uni pour soutenir les entreprises \u00e0 fort potentiel au cours des cinq prochaines ann\u00e9es. Notes to editors L'\u00e9quipe dirigeante d'OrganOx comprend Craig Marshall , PDG, qui a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 au poste de PDG en 2017 et a dirig\u00e9 les efforts de l'entreprise depuis lors ; Stephen Deitsch , directeur financier, qui a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le central dans la mise en place de la plateforme qui a permis \u00e0 l'entreprise de se d\u00e9velopper, et qui a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le essentiel dans le succ\u00e8s de la lev\u00e9e de fonds de 160 millions de dollars de l'entreprise en f\u00e9vrier 2025 et dans la r\u00e9alisation de cette sortie ; Rupa Basu , directeur commercial mondial, qui a rejoint l'entreprise en 2022 et a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le central dans le lancement et le d\u00e9veloppement r\u00e9ussis de l'entreprise sur le march\u00e9 des \u00c9tats-Unis.

Craig Marshall , PDG d'OrganOx, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab Une fois que BGF a eu un si\u00e8ge au conseil d'administration en 2019, occup\u00e9 par Tim Rea , je savais que si nous parvenions \u00e0 maintenir notre concentration et notre \u00e9lan en tant qu'entreprise et \u00e9quipe, OrganOx ne manquerait pas de fonds \u00e0 l'avenir. La conviction de BGF ne s'est pas d\u00e9mentie et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a non seulement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque tour de table apr\u00e8s son premier investissement, mais elle a \u00e9galement initi\u00e9 et fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 un certain nombre de ces tours de table \u00bb.

The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations (as defined herein) are being conducted in connection with, and are conditioned upon, among other things, the completion of the Merger.

The adoption of the Proposed Amendments for each Existing IPG Indenture requires the consent of the Eligible Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the applicable series of Existing IPG Notes (each a \"Majority Noteholder Consent\" and, collectively, the \"Majority Noteholder Consents\"). The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are being made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement, dated August 11, 2025 (the \"Statement\").

(2) For each $1,000 principal amount of Existing IPG Notes accepted for exchange. (3) The Consent Payment and the Early Tender Payment will be paid to Eligible Holders (as defined herein) on the settlement date. In order to be eligible to receive the Consent Payment, Eligible Holders of Existing IPG Notes must, at or prior to the Early Tender Date (as defined herein), validly deliver and not validly revoke their related consents, even if such person is no longer the beneficial owner of such Existing IPG Notes on the Expiration Date (as defined herein). (4) The New Omnicom Notes will accrue interest from (and including) the most recent date on which interest has been paid on the corresponding series of Existing IPG Notes accepted in the Exchange Offers. If, at the Early Tender Date, Majority Noteholder Consents have been received, then the Exchange Consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing IPG Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date will equal $1,000 principal amount of the applicable series of the New Omnicom Notes. (5) Includes the Consent Payment and the Early Tender Payment. Eligible Holders who (i) validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Existing IPG Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m. , New York City time, on August 22, 2025 , unless extended (the \"Early Tender Date\") or terminated, (ii) validly deliver and do not validly revoke their related consent in the applicable Consent Solicitation at or prior to the Early Tender Date, and (iii) beneficially own such Existing IPG Notes at the Expiration Date, will be eligible to receive the applicable Total Exchange Consideration as set forth in the table above, which includes the applicable Early Tender Payment and Consent Payment as set forth in the table, for all such Existing IPG Notes that are accepted. Eligible Holders who (i) validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Existing IPG Notes after the Early Tender Date and prior to 5:00 p.m. , New York City time, on September 9, 2025 , unless extended (the \"Expiration Date\"), (ii) validly deliver and do not validly revoke their related consents in the applicable Consent Solicitation after the Early Tender Date and prior to the Expiration Date, and (iii) beneficially own such Existing IPG Notes at the Expiration Date, will be eligible to receive (A) $970 principal amount of the applicable series of New Omnicom Notes if consents sufficient to effect the Proposed Amendments are not received by the Early Tender Date or (B) if, at the Early Tender Date, consents sufficient to effect the Proposed Amendments have been received, $1,000 principal amount of such series of New Omnicom Notes ((A) and (B), as applicable, the \"Exchange Consideration\"). The settlement date will be promptly after the Expiration Date and is expected to be within two business days after the Expiration Date. To the extent the completion of the Merger is not anticipated to occur on or before the then-anticipated settlement date, for any reason, Omnicom anticipates extending the Expiration Date until such time that the Merger has been consummated. Any such extension of the Expiration Date will cause a corresponding extension of the settlement date. During any extension of the Expiration Date, all Existing IPG Notes previously tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in an extended Exchange Offer will remain subject to such Exchange Offer and may be accepted for exchange by Omnicom. Each New Omnicom Note issued in the Exchange Offers for a validly tendered Existing IPG Note will have an interest rate and maturity date that is identical to the interest rate and maturity date of the tendered Existing IPG Note, as well as identical interest payment dates and optional redemption prices. The New Omnicom Notes will be general unsecured senior obligations of Omnicom and will rank equally in right of payment with all of Omnicom's other unsecured senior indebtedness. The terms of the covenants, related exceptions to such covenants and the events of default, among other provisions, to which the New Omnicom Notes are subject are materially different than the covenants, related exceptions and events of default to which the Existing IPG Notes are subject. Eligible Holders should refer to the Statement for more information on the terms of the New Omnicom Notes. The New Omnicom Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. No tender of Existing IPG Notes will be accepted if it results in the issuance of less than the minimum authorized denomination principal amount of New Omnicom Notes. If, pursuant to the Exchange Offers, a tendering Eligible Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive a principal amount of New Omnicom Notes that is not equal to the minimum authorized denomination or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, such principal amount will be rounded down to the minimum authorized denomination or the nearest integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, and such Eligible Holder will receive pursuant to the Exchange Offers this rounded principal amount of New Omnicom Notes plus (a) cash equal to the principal amount of New Omnicom Notes not received as a result of rounding down, and (b) cash equal to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing IPG Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, but are not exchanged for New Omnicom Notes as a result of rounding down. Each Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including among other things, the completion of the Merger and the completion of each of the other Exchange Offers and receipt of the Majority Noteholder Consents in each of the Consent Solicitations. Eligible Holders of Existing IPG Notes will not receive the Exchange Consideration or the Total Exchange Consideration, as applicable, unless such conditions are met or are otherwise waived by Omnicom (other than the condition that the Merger shall have been completed). The parties' obligations to complete the Merger are conditioned upon (i) the receipt of remaining regulatory approvals and (ii) certain other customary closing conditions. The completion of the Merger is not subject to the completion of the Exchange Offers or Consent Solicitations. Eligible Holders may not deliver a consent in the Consent Solicitations without tendering Existing IPG Notes in the applicable Exchange Offer. If an Eligible Holder tenders Existing IPG Notes in an Exchange Offer, such Eligible Holder will be deemed to deliver its consent with respect to the principal amount of such tendered Existing IPG Notes to the corresponding Proposed Amendments. Tenders of Existing IPG Notes may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date; however the related consent delivered by such Eligible Holder may not be withdrawn after the earlier of (i) 5:00 p.m. , New York City time, on the Early Tender Date and (ii) the date the applicable supplemental indenture to the Existing IPG Indenture implementing the Proposed Amendments to the Existing IPG Notes Indenture is executed (the earlier of (i) and (ii), the \"Consent Revocation Deadline\"). An Eligible Holder that validly tenders Existing IPG Notes and validly delivers (and does not validly revoke) a consent prior to the Early Tender Date, but withdraws such Existing IPG Notes after the Early Tender Date but prior to the Expiration Date, will receive the Consent Payment, even if such Eligible Holder is no longer the beneficial owner of such Existing IPG Notes at the Expiration Date. Omnicom may complete the Exchange Offers even if valid consents sufficient to effect the Proposed Amendments to the applicable Existing IPG Indenture are not received. The Statement and other documents relating to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations will only be distributed to holders of Existing IPG Notes who complete and return a letter of eligibility certifying that they are (i) \"qualified institutional buyers\" within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\") or (ii) not \"U.S. persons\" and are outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act and who are \"non-U.S. qualified offerees\" (as defined in the Statement) (such persons, \"Eligible Holders\"). Only Eligible Holders are authorized to receive and review the Statement and only Eligible Holders are permitted to tender Existing IPG Notes in the Exchange Offers and deliver consents in the Consent Solicitations. Eligible Holders of Existing IPG Notes who desire to obtain and complete the letter of eligibility and obtain copies of the Statement should call D.F. King & Co., Inc., the Exchange and Information Agent, at (800) 290-6432 (toll-free) or (212) 401-9970 (collect for banks and brokers). Information related to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, together with any updates, will be available at www.dfking.com/omnicom . Among other risks described in the Statement, the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are expected to result in reduced liquidity for the Existing IPG Notes that are not exchanged and, if adopted, the Proposed Amendments to the Existing IPG Indenture will reduce protection to remaining holders of Existing IPG Notes. Eligible Holders should refer to the Statement for more details on the risks related to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. Omnicom has engaged BofA Securities, Inc., J.P.

Any Notes not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer will remain outstanding. If the Consents are received with respect to a series of Notes, and the Proposed Amendments become operative with respect to the Indenture for such series of Notes, then the applicable Notes that are not purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer will be subject to the Proposed Amendments. To the extent any Notes remain outstanding, the Parent may cause the Company to redeem such Notes after the closing of the Merger and the consummation of the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms of the Indentures as amended by the Proposed Amendments, as applicable.

Constant updates to regulatory frameworks demand continuous investment in quality systems, which create issues for medical device contract manufacturing companies and slow down-market development. OEMs show hesitation to fully outsource their manufacturing due to concerns over intellectual property (IP) protection and quality control. High risk of data breaches or misuse, especially in cross-border contracts is further impeding the adoption of medical device contract manufacturing in the future. Ensuring strict quality management systems and IP safeguards is often costly and difficult, particularly with newer or smaller CMOs. These concerns hinder trust and limit the extent of outsourcing, restraining the broader adoption of contract manufacturing in the medical device sector.

To accelerate expansion into the U.S. market, BCE and PSP Investments announced earlier this year a strategic partnership to create Network FiberCo . Combined with the completion of the Ziply Fiber acquisition, this long-term strategic partnership will enable Bell to potentially reach up to 8 million fibre locations in the U.S., reinforcing its position as the third-largest fibre Internet provider in North America .

Ziply Fiber will operate as a separate business unit and will continue to be headquartered in Kirkland, Washington , with its existing management team and highly skilled workforce in alignment with Bell's strategic priority of building the best fibre Internet networks. Together, Bell and Ziply Fiber will offer enhanced value for existing and new customers in both Canada and\u00a0the United States as demand for faster, more reliable Internet continues to grow. BCE will update its 2025 financial guidance targets to reflect the Ziply Fiber acquisition when it reports Q2 2025 results on August 7 . \"The acquisition of Ziply Fiber marks a key milestone in our fibre growth strategy by establishing a significant foothold in the attractive U.S. market.

The proposed transaction is expected to accelerate Waystar's ability to transform healthcare payments through its leading cloud-based software platform, empowering more than one million providers with advanced AI capabilities to prevent denials, reduce manual work, and improve financial performance. Building on Waystar's track record of successful M&A execution and synergy realization, Waystar expects the acquisition of Iodine to be immediately accretive to gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin, and accretive to revenue growth and non-GAAP net income per diluted share in 2027. Iodine is trusted by many of the nation's premier health systems for its AI-powered clinical intelligence software. Up to 60 million claims are denied each year due to administrative errors in the critical stage between care delivery and submission, costing providers billions in lost revenue. This highlights the essential role of accurate clinical documentation and coding in preventing revenue leakage and underpayments. Together, Waystar and Iodine will be better positioned to help decrease the estimated $440 billion in annual administrative costs 1 burdening providers. Waystar brings a decade-long track record of applying AI pervasively across its software platform to simplify healthcare payments. Iodine extends that leadership into clinical intelligence software, leveraging proprietary AI models trained on one of the industry's largest clinical datasets, representing more than a third of all U.S. inpatient discharges. \"Our mission is to simplify healthcare payments by eradicating unnecessary denied claims, automating manual work, and increasing transparency for providers and patients,\" said Matt Hawkins , Chief Executive Officer of Waystar. \"We are committed to transforming healthcare through harnessing the power of AI to tackle the most critical challenges in healthcare payments.

Upon closing of the transaction, current Waystar shareholders will own approximately 92% of the combined company on a fully diluted, pro forma basis and Iodine equity holders will own approximately 8%. Advent, Iodine's largest shareholder, is expected to only receive Waystar shares in connection with the transaction and will agree to be locked up for 18 months after closing. Following the transaction, Waystar expects to maintain a strong balance sheet with an estimated adjusted net leverage ratio at transaction close of approximately 3.5x. The transaction is anticipated to close by year-end 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals. Preliminary Second Quarter 2025 Results Waystar expects second quarter 2025 revenue to be approximately $271 million , representing approximately 15% year-over-year growth.

This acquisition by Pacific Petroleum Holdings, LP, a Delaware -based investment vehicle was backed by institutional investors from Japan . The structure for Pacific Petroleum leverages a U.S. tax blocker (Pacific Petroleum Blocker, LLC) to facilitate cross-border efficiency for its overseas investors. Pacific Petroleum Management, LLC serves as the general partner for Pacific Petroleum. Field operations will be managed by VCP Wyoming, LLC, an affiliate of VCP Operating and a subsidiary of VCP Michigan, a proven operator with experience in Michigan , Texas , and multiple North American basins. The acquired assets span multiple actively producing fields, including the Hunt, Rose Creek , Shoshone North, and West Oregon Basin fields. The properties are characterized by stable base production, low decline rates, and near-term optimization opportunities. Future Technology Integration Plan Pacific Petroleum's acquisition framework benefits from the expertise of Koji Muto , General Partner of Pacific Petroleum Management, LLC, and Geoff Masaaki Ayres , CEO of O-DE Capital Partners ( Hong Kong ), who jointly oversee the fund's cross-border capital structuring and long-term digital innovation initiatives. O-DE Capital, a specialist in Web3 and fintech-enabled asset management, is advising on the potential integration of next-generation technologies\u2014including real-world asset (RWA) tokenization\u2014to enhance operational transparency and investor liquidity. Comments from Stakeholders Jason Nye , Managing Director of Pacific Petroleum Management, LLC, stated: \"We are proud to have completed this strategic acquisition that represents a major step forward in our U.S. energy investment strategy. Together with a strong and experienced business associate in VCP Operating, we aim to deliver sustainable value and dependable returns.\" Toby Darden , Founder of VCP Operating, LLC, commented: \"VCP brings over three decades of field-level operational experience. We are excited to collaborate with Pacific and leverage our on-the-ground capabilities to unlock further value from this portfolio.\" Koji Muto , General Partner of Pacific Bays Capital/ Director of O-DE Capital, commented: \"This fund represents the 'stability' component of Pacific Bays Capital's core philosophy of 'balancing innovation with stability.' While oil & gas PDP (Proved Developed Producing) assets are legacy investments generating reliable cash flows, their tangible nature makes them exceptionally compatible with digital asset innovations like RWA tokenization. We believe technological advancement could transform these assets into new financial infrastructure. O-DE Capital will fully support the implementation of Web3 technologies to enhance transparency and facilitate secondary market liquidity. Furthermore, PDP investments have traditionally been a 'closed' market accessible only to seasoned operators and select private equity funds. Through the combination of technology and institutional framework design, we aim to lower barriers to entry and transform this exclusive domain into an open, accessible market.\" Market Outlook This acquisition in Wyoming's prolific resource base comes at a strategically advantageous time.\u00a0 Given the current strength in WTI and the economic resilience of these mature Wyoming oil assets, we see this acquisition as a compelling opportunity to enhance operating margins and long-term project value.\u00a0 Added pressures to global markets from expanding international security risks, especially in the Middle East , could further increase pricing.\u00a0 Forward-looking statements are based on current market data as of June 2025 and are subject to change. Market Commentary Wyoming's mature oil assets remain compelling investments, offering stable production and low breakeven costs that withstand market volatility. As energy security concerns grow, these conventional reserves maintain strategic relevance during the global energy transition. Pacific Petroleum further enhances the portfolio's resilience through technology\u2014including data-driven field management and potential RWA tokenization\u2014bridging traditional energy investing with next-generation transparency and efficiency tools. - Pacific Bays Capital GP Jason Nye - About\u00a0VCP Founded by industry veterans Jeff Cook and Toby Darden , VCP has developed and operated over 64,000 acres in the Michigan Basin, reaching production rates of over 10,000 MCFD within its first year of operation.

(\"WORIO\"), a South Korean medical device company developing next-generation noninvasive glucose monitoring technology. The agreement sets forth certain key terms for a strategic acquisition of WORIO by OSR Holdings' Korean affiliate, OSR Holdings Co., Ltd. (\"OSRK\"). Under the proposed structure,\u00a0WORIO will become a wholly owned subsidiary of OSRK.

Specifically, WORIO shareholders may convert their OSRK shares into OSRH shares at a fixed exchange ratio of 1 OSRK share = 12.96 OSRH shares, provided that OSRH's stock price reaches $10.00 at least once within three years following the signing of the Term Sheet.

Noninvasive alternatives hold tremendous promise and are poised to become an integral part of diabetes management in the future. WORIO has completed a proof-of-concept study with the Korea University Hospital (Guro) to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of its prototype devices and the data measured by them, based on which the company plans to enter a larger confirmatory trial to be registered with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) of Korea for medical device approval pathway.

    "content": "COVINGTON, La. and METAIRIE, La. , July 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Heritage NOLA Bancorp, Inc. (\"Heritage NOLA Bancorp\") (OTC Pink: HRGG), the holding company for Heritage Bank of St. Tammany (\"Heritage Bank\"), Heritage Bank and OnPath Federal Credit Union (\"OnPath Credit Union\") announced today that OnPath Credit Union, Heritage NOLA Bancorp and Heritage Bank have signed a definitive purchase and assumption agreement whereby OnPath Credit Union will acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities (including all of the deposit account liabilities) of Heritage Bank in an all-cash transaction (the \"P&A Transaction\"). As consideration for the P&A Transaction, OnPath Credit Union\u00a0has agreed to pay Heritage Bank $26,000,000 in cash and will additionally reimburse Heritage Bank up to $2,000,000 for the payout of its liquidation account and up to $1,000,000 for Heritage NOLA Bancorp's tax liabilities resulting from the P&A Transaction. Following the completion of the P&A Transaction and after all of the respective obligations of Heritage NOLA Bancorp and Heritage Bank (including settlement of the liquidation account maintained by Heritage Bank) are settled, Heritage Bank will liquidate and distribute its remaining assets to Heritage NOLA Bancorp (the \"liquidation\") and then Heritage NOLA Bancorp will dissolve and distribute its remaining assets to its shareholders (the \"dissolution\"). Heritage NOLA Bancorp's shareholders are currently estimated to receive between $20.00 and $20.75 in cash in exchange for each share of Heritage NOLA Bancorp common stock owned (the \"per share consideration\"). Currently, Heritage NOLA Bancorp has 1,239,680 shares of common stock outstanding. The per share consideration is subject to significant variation based on various factors including the amount of corporate taxation to be paid by Heritage NOLA Bancorp in the P&A Transaction; the costs associated with the payout of a liquidation account; costs related to the liquidation and the distribution of Heritage Bank's remaining assets to Heritage NOLA Bancorp; and costs related to the dissolution and the distribution of Heritage NOLA Bancorp's remaining assets to its shareholders. Based on these factors, investors should not assume that the ultimate per share consideration distributed to shareholders will be within the range set forth above. The P&A agreement was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Heritage NOLA Bancorp, Heritage Bank and OnPath\u00a0Credit Union. The parties expect the P&A Transaction to close in the second quarter of 2026, subject to receiving all regulatory approvals, approval by Heritage NOLA Bancorp's shareholders and other customary closing conditions. The distribution of cash representing the per share consideration to Heritage NOLA Bancorp's shareholders is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2026, although delays in the liquidation and dissolution could delay the distribution to shareholders. Under the terms of a liquidation account established by Heritage Bank at the time of its mutual-to-stock conversion in 2017, it is expected that eligible depositors of Heritage Bank as of the date of the conversion who continued to have eligible deposits as of each year end between the closing of the conversion and through the year end prior to the closing of the P&A Transaction could have the right to receive a liquidation account payment. \"We have long admired Heritage Bank of St. Tammany for its 100-year legacy of service and its unwavering commitment to the local community. I have great respect for the values they've upheld and the trust they've built with generations of residents. Welcoming them into the OnPath Credit Union family marks a meaningful step in our continued growth and expansion across Southeast Louisiana .

Court confirmation of the final plan and approval of the sale is anticipated in early September. The proposed plan was amended to include a new trust structure that will allow general unsecured claimants, including litigation plaintiffs, to continue asserting claims through the trust as it pursues recoveries from non-debtor parties. Additionally, Exactech will receive approximately $60 million of additional financing (for a total of approximately $150 million ), provided by Exactech's proposed new owners, to ensure adequate funding as the company continues business as usual operations during the remainder of the proceedings. After the Court confirms the final plan and approves the sale, the company's new owners - which include Strategic Value Partners, LLC (together with its affiliates, \"SVP\"), Stellex Capital Management, LLC, and Greywolf Capital Management LP - will acquire substantially all of Exactech's operations and assets free and clear, forming a new company strategically positioned for long-term success executing its mission to be the leading surgeon partner in orthopedics. \"This agreement represents a significant milestone on the path to Court approval of our plan of reorganization and emergence under new ownership,\" said Exactech President and CEO Darin Johnson . \"We look forward to the Court's approval of the sale and confirmation of the plan over the next several weeks.
